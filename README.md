# European_Language_Classification

This project refers to the Startup.ml challenge https://startup.ml/. The challenge is detecting European languages on the Europarl corpus. 

I have used the scikit learn package and worked with the Logistic regression for the model using n-gram approach. 
My F-score was 0.97 which is surpising as well and the model was trained on a smaller set of the data from the large corpus because running locally would make a "Memory error".I have written a detailed explanation on the Short notebook which walks through my code and understanding and also some key insights and future work. 

As people in the field of data science and machine learning ,we need to be able to convey our results and I have made my attempt in doing so.I would encourage you to take a look and would be more than happy to discuss and learn more on this. 

I take this moment to thank Alex Miller for giving me an opportunity to work on this amazing problem and made me learn a lot during the process.It would be fascinating to work, research and learn more in the same. Thank you.


PS: This was a fun challenge, Running on local machine definetely takes a lot of time and processing power. Hope to run the entire code on AWS. It was amazing to try out different algorithms on seperate notebooks, Fasttext, Random forests, Xgboost and learn a lot about NLP and handling text data. The important part was about data pre processing and how it is reduced to a cleaner data set.
